Summary:
1. The program prompts the user to enter the filename of the file containing data
2. The program then reads each binary number as a string
3. The string is traversed to pull out the data bits, check bits, and calculated check bits
4. The results are printed to the user. If the calculated check bits and actual check bits do not match,
	the correced binary string is printed.
